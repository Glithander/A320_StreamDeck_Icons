# A320_StreamDeck_Icons
A set of Icons based on Airbus A320nx buttons and switches, intended for use on StreamDeck XL 

Created by Michael Dugas (glithndr@whitestar.org)

Notes: 
* There are two basic sets of Icons: 
    - Those with the 'A320_' prefix are from an earlier design.  Text and Icon elements are larger for readability. 
    - Those with the 'A320nx_' prefix are a new design, and have smaller text and icon elements, but are a bit closer to what is in the airbus.

Feel free to use these as you see fit.  Some knobs are designed to be spread across two buttons on the stream deck as an 'Increment' and 'Decrement' - and I've tried to adjust the graphic to make the 'bar' between them less noticable. 

Requests for additional switches welcome.  

Currently Complete (320nx only):
* ADIRS (1, 2, 3)
* Bat 1/Bat 2/Ext PWR
* L/C/R Pumps (I've consolidated them to three buttons instead of six)
* Anti Ics
* APU
* External Lights
* Seatbelt/No Smoking (renamed Personal Electronics)
* Emer Lights switch

Working on the Glareshield.
